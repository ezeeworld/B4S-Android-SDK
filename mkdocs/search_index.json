It will register the device with the Neer.by server (but won't search for beacons, or display notifications, or send geolocalized information to our server). If you want to fully control when the device will be registered to our back-end, set \nby.neer.sdk.AUTOSTART\n and \nby.neer.sdk.DISABLE_AUTOMATIC_INIT\n keys to your Manifest, with respectively \nfalse\n and \ntrue\n value.\n\n\nxml\n \nmeta-data android:name=\"by.neer.sdk.AUTOSTART\" android:value=\"false\" /\n\n \nmeta-data android:name=\"by.neer.sdk.DISABLE_AUTOMATIC_INIT\" android:value=\"true\" /\n\n\n\n\nImport the SDK in your Application subclass:\n\n\n\n\nimport com.ezeeworld.b4s.android.sdk.B4SSettings;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart the SDK in the \nonCreate\n method:\n\n\n\n\nB4SSettings settings = B4SSettings.init(this);\nsettings.go();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally startup the new geolocation tracking module :\n\n\n\n\npublic static LocationAwareThread lat = null;\n\nlat = LocationAwareThread.get();\nif (lat == null) {\n    lat = new LocationAwareThread(getApplicationContext());\n}\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n: Geolocation is required by the SDK. So you have to request \nandroid.Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION\n permission before calling B4SSettings.get().go()\n\n\n\n\nOn demand SDK activation\n\n\n\n\nThere is several way to condition SDK activation :\n\n\n1) Test location permission to prevent activation before permission are set.\n\n\nint res = PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED;\nif (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT \n= Build.VERSION_CODES.M) {\n  res = getApplicationContext().checkSelfPermission(android.Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION);\n}\nLog.d(\nB4S\n, \nHabitsApplication init res=\n+res);\nif (res == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {\n  // Init SDK here\n}\n\n\n\n\n2) Test SharedPreferences value to locally enable SDK :\n\n\nboolean activateSdk = sharedPreferences.getBoolean(SDK_ACTIVATION, true);\nif (activateSdk) {\n  // Init SDK here\n}\n\n\n\n\nPrevent your application to trigger notifications resulting of mock locations\n\n\nOn Android, some applications (like Lockito) can generate mock locations (typically for debuging purpose). By default, mock locations are authorised by the Neer.by SDK. You can disable them with the following code :\n\n\nB4SSettings.get().setDiscardMockLocations(true);\n\n\n\n\nRecording user data\n\n\nNeerby can relate events to individual customers. Supplying the customer details is typically done on startup and/or after a user signed in to his/her account. In these cases you can update te SDK with this customer data (which is persisted; no need to call this every time). The key should use reverse-dns-like notation to be used as a domain. For instance, the user hometown should use a \"user.hometown\" key. A few keys are provided (Firstname, lastname, gender...)\n\n\nWhen the last parameter is set to false, the key/value is uploaded to our server. Uploaded key/values can be used to target users on interactions.\n\n\nB4SUserProperty.get().store(B4SUserProperty.USER_FIRST_NAME, \nJean-Michel\n, false);\nB4SUserProperty.get().store(B4SUserProperty.USER_LAST_NAME, \nB\u00e9catresse\n, false);\nB4SUserProperty.get().store(B4SUserProperty.USER_GENDER, B4SUserProperty.Gender.Male, true);\nB4SUserProperty.get().store(\nuser.hometown\n, \nTubbydome\n, true);\n\n\n\n\nApplication tagging\n\n\nYou can tag your application with the B4S SDK. You have to specify 2 informations :\n\u2022 A tag type\n\u2022 A data dictionnary with the datas associated to your tag.\n\n\nHashMap\nString, Object\n hmap = new HashMap();\nhmap.put(\nKey1\n, \nString1\n);\nhmap.put(\nKey2\n, 123);\nNeerbyTag.newEvent(getApplicationContext(), \nUserNavigation\n, hmap, true);\n\n\n\n\nCustom notifications\n\n\nIcons, icon background colour and vibration can be customised on notifications.\n\n\nB4SSettings.get().setNotificationBackgroundColor(0xff111111);\nB4SSettings.get().setCustomNotificationSmallIcon(R.drawable.ic_notifsmall);\nB4SSettings.get().setCustomNotificationLargeIcon(R.drawable.ic_notiflarge);\nB4SSettings.get().setShouldVibrateOnNotification(true);\nB4SSettings.get().setVibrationPattern(new long[]{100, 300, 100, 300});\nB4SSettings.get().setShouldRingOnNotification(true);\nB4SSettings.get().enableNotificationSound();\n\n\n\n\nPush notifications\n\n\nTo use remote push notifications you must first follow the instructions of the \"Base integration\"\n\n\nTo use remote push messaging with the Neerby SDK, ensure that the \nfirebase-messaging\n library is properly specified in your \napp/build.gradle\n dependencies:\n\n\n{\n    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:17.6.0'\n}\n\n\n\n\n...and init the 'google-services' plugin too :\n\n\n{\n    apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'\n}\n\n\n\n\nAdd the following class to your project. This class handle events from Firebase Messaging and transmits them to the Neerby SDK.\n\n\npackage x.y.z.myapp;\n\nimport android.app.Activity;\nimport android.content.Context;\n\nimport com.ezeeworld.b4s.android.sdk.B4SLog;\nimport com.ezeeworld.b4s.android.sdk.push.PushApi;\nimport com.google.android.gms.tasks.OnSuccessListener;\nimport com.google.firebase.FirebaseApp;\nimport com.google.firebase.iid.FirebaseInstanceId;\nimport com.google.firebase.iid.InstanceIdResult;\nimport com.google.firebase.messaging.FirebaseMessagingService;\nimport com.google.firebase.messaging.RemoteMessage;\n\npublic class NeerByFirebaseMessagingService extends FirebaseMessagingService {\n    private final static String TAG = \nPushApi\n;\n\n    @Override\n    public void onNewToken(String newToken) {\n        super.onNewToken(newToken);\n\n        PushApi.registerFirebaseToken(newToken);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onMessageReceived(RemoteMessage remoteMessage) {\n        super.onMessageReceived(remoteMessage);\n\n        PushApi.onMessageReceived(getApplicationContext(), remoteMessage.getData());\n    }\n\n    public static void initFirebase(Activity activity) {\n        try {\n            FirebaseApp.initializeApp(activity);\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            B4SLog.e(\nPushAPI\n, \nFirebaseApp init failed:\n+e.toString());\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n\n        FirebaseInstanceId.getInstance().getInstanceId().addOnSuccessListener( activity,  new OnSuccessListener\nInstanceIdResult\n() {\n            @Override\n            public void onSuccess(InstanceIdResult instanceIdResult) {\n                String newToken = instanceIdResult.getToken();\n                PushApi.registerFirebaseToken(newToken);\n            }\n        });\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nAdd the following declaration in your application AndroidManifest.xml\n\n\nservice\n    android:name=\n.NeerByFirebaseMessagingService\n\n    android:stopWithTask=\nfalse\n\n    android:exported=\nfalse\n\n    \nintent-filter\n\n        \naction android:name=\ncom.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT\n /\n\n    \n/intent-filter\n\n\n/service\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, add the folowing line to initialize Firebase messaging. Typically, it can be done in your Main Activity class.\n\n\nNeerByFirebaseMessagingService.initFirebase(this);\n\n\n\n\nImportant, do not forget to add your 'google-services.json' in your application source path. You will generate this file from the Firebase console at : https://console.firebase.google.com in Project Overview \nParameters (General tab).\nNext, you will have to record the legacy server key (Cloud Messageing tab) in the Neerby web interface (application settings).\n\n\nDeep linking\n\n\nNotifications such as web links or simple messages are handled directly by the SDK. For deep linking (and deep linking only), there are three options:\n\n\n\n\nDeepLinkStyle.LaunchActivityClearTask\n - (Default) Deep links are delivered to your launch Activity, and always in a new task (with an Activity restart)\n\n\nDeepLinkStyle.LaunchActivityDirect\n - Deep links are delivered to your launch Activity; if this is already running the Intent is delivered directly to your \nonNewIntent\n lifecycle method\n\n\nDeepLinkStyle.BroadcastReceiver\n - Deep links are broadcasted with a \ncom.ezeeworld.b4s.android.sdk.notifications.DEEP_LINK\n Intent action type\n\n\n\n\nThe strategy can be set by calling a static method, typically after you have initialized the SDK in your \nApplication\n class:\n\n\n   NotificationService.registerDeepLinkStyle(NotificationService.DeepLinkStyle deepLinkStyle);\n\n\n\n\nWhen you configure to use \nDeepLinkStyle.BroadcastReceiver\n deep links, the application can and must register a \nBroadcastReceiver\n that handles the deep links, such as opening a specific Activity or starting a Service. In your \nAndroidManifest.xml\n you declare:\n\n\n   \nreceiver android:name=\n.DeepLinkReceiver\n\n      \nintent-filter\n\n         \naction android:name=\ncom.ezeeworld.b4s.android.sdk.notifications.DEEP_LINK\n /\n\n      \n/intent-filter\n\n   \n/receiver\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nDeepLinkReceiver\n can, in its simplest form, simply relay the broadcasts to some other Activity:\n\n\n    public class DeepLinkReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {\n       @Override\n       public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {\n          intent.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK); // Required as no Activity context is available\n          context.startActivity(intent);\n       }\n    }\n\n\n\n\nDeep link \nIntent\ns contain a bundle of extras to respond appropriately:\n\n\n\n\nNotificationService.INTENT_SHOW\n - (int) Hash code of the interaction that was matched\n\n\nNotificationService.INTENT_INTERACTIONNAME\n - (String) Name interaction that was matched\n\n\nNotificationService.INTENT_INTERACTION\n - (String) Unique ID of the interaction that was matched\n\n\nNotificationService.INTENT_CAMPAIGN\n - (String) Unique ID of the campaign the matched interaction belongs to\n\n\nNotificationService.INTENT_CAMPAIGNNAME\n - (String) Name of the campaign the matched interaction belongs to\n\n\nNotificationService.INTENT_TITLE\n - (String) Message title, defaults to interaction name if no custom title was supplied\n\n\nNotificationService.INTENT_MESSAGE\n - (String) Message, in which customer name, beacon name, shop name, etc. were already substituted\n\n\nNotificationService.INTENT_SHOPNAME\n - (String) Name of the interaction's shop\n\n\nNotificationService.INTENT_SHOPCLIENTREF\n - (String) The free-form string set on the shop as client reference\n\n\nNotificationService.INTENT_GROUPNAME\n - (String) Name of the interaction's group\n\n\nNotificationService.INTENT_ACTIONID\n - (String) The free-form string with the campaign action id set as deep link reference\n\n\nNotificationService.INTENT_BEACONNAME\n - (String) Name of the matched beacon as configured in the SDK\n\n\nNotificationService.INTENT_BEACONID\n - (IBeaconID) Beacon identification, including technical name (B4S:XXXX:XXXX), UDID, major and minor\n\n\nNotificationService.INTENT_BEACONCLIENTREF\n - (String) The free-form string set on the beacon as client reference\n\n\nNotificationService.INTENT_DISTANCE\n - (double) Distance estimate in meters\n\n\nNotificationService.INTENT_SHOPLATITUDE\n - (double) Latitude of the shop associated to the notification\n\n\nNotificationService.INTENT_SHOPLONGITUDE\n - (double) Longitude of the shop associated to the notification\n\n\nNotificationService.INTENT_TIMESTAMP\n - (double) Timestamp (in seconds) of notification trigger time\n\n\n\n\nDynamic notifications customisation\n\n\nYou have the possibility to let your code modify every notification before they are display to the use.\n\n\nIn order to achieve this, you had to :\n\n\n\n\nAdd the NotificationService.NotificationModifier interface to the class which will be responsible of the notifications customisation.\n\n\nRegister the previous class with \n\n\n\n\n    NotificationService.registerNotificationModifier(this);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplements the two methods :\n\n\n\n\npublic String modifyNotificationTitle(Bundle extras) {\n\n}\n\npublic String modifyNotificationMessage(Bundle extras) {\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe string returned by these methods will be respectively the modified title and message of the notification. You can even modify the notification properties of the notifications.\n\n\nNotifications customisation using placeholders\n\n\nYou can automatically customise some items displayed within notifications :\n * Notification title\n * Notification text\n * URLs used for deeplink or rich pushes.\n\n\nThis can be achieved by inserting predefined placeholders in the corresponding items. Theses placeholders are :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   This placeholder will be replaced with the name of the beacon which triggered the notification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   This placeholder will be replaced with the reference code you eventually assigned to the beacon which triggered the notification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   This placeholder will be replaced with the name of the shop associated to the notification (shop the beacon belongs to or location name of the virtual beacon)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   This placeholder will be replaced with the reference code of the shop associated to the notification (shop the beacon belongs to or location name of the virtual beacon)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   This placeholder will be replaced with the city name of the shop associated to the notification (shop the beacon belongs to or location name of the virtual beacon)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   This placeholder will be replaced with the zip code of the shop associated to the notification (shop the beacon belongs to or location name of the virtual beacon)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   This placeholder will be replaced with the value of the USER_LAST_NAME UserProperty you should have previously set with the following code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB4SUserProperty.get().store(B4SUserProperty.USER_LAST_NAME, \nB\u00e9catresse\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   This placeholder will be replaced with the value of the USER_FIRST_NAME UserProperty you should have previously set with the following code.\n\n\n\n\nB4SUserProperty.get().store(B4SUserProperty.USER_FIRST_NAME, \nJean-Michel\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   This placeholder will be replaced with the value of the USER_CLIENT_REF UserProperty you should have previously set with the following code.\n\n\n\n\nB4SUserProperty.get().store(B4SUserProperty.USER_CLIENT_REF, \nEE123\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   This placeholder will be replaced with the timestamp (in seconds ) of the notification generation.\n\n\n\n\nAndroid 6\n\n\nWith Android 6.0 (API level 23) a new permission system was introduced by Google. On Android 6 devices, users can manually manage permissions on a per-application basis. If an app targets Android 6 (using targetSdkVersion 23 and compileSdkVersion 23), an app also needs to deal with runtime permissions. This means that permissions such as location access (which is now a so-called 'dangerous' permission) needs to be explicitly requested with a permission request pop-up. Until SDK version 1.4.2, the B4S SDK does not handle this automatically and therefor the integrator needs to \nhandle permission request dialogs manually\n.\n\n\nFrom version 1.5.0 onwards this will be handled for you by the SDK. A request to access the user location will automatically be shown when access was not yet granted. It is important to note that this affects any application when running on an Android 6 device, even those that still target API level 22 or lower.\n\n\nUsing a transient device UUID\n\n\nWarning\n: using this feature is \nnot\n recommended\n\n\nUpon the app installation, an anymous and persistent device UUID is used if the app is un-installed then re-installed. To make this ID transient add a \nby.neer.sdk.USE_TRANSIENT_DEVICEID\n key to your AndroidManifest.xml, with the value \ntrue\n in the application block.\n\n\nmeta-data android:name=\nby.neer.sdk.USE_TRANSIENT_DEVICEID\n android:value=\ntrue\n /\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting the user's workplace and home coordinates\n\n\nThe SDK tries to determinate the user's home \n workplace coordinate. When accessing those, home and workplace coordinates should be null if the SDK still do not collect enough information to identify the customer home and workplace locations.\n\n\n\nLocation home = B4SSettings.get().userHomeCoordinates();\nif (home != null)\n{\n    // Use the coordinates\n}\nLocation work = B4SSettings.get().userWorkplaceCoordinates();\nif (work != null)\n{\n    // Use the coordinates\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting info about the nearest beacon\n\n\n\nIBeaconData beaconData = SessionManager.get(null).getNearestBeacon();\n// Some properties that can be retrieved\nbeaconData.getDistance();\nbeaconData.getID().getInnerName();\nbeaconData.getID().getUuid();\nbeaconData.getID().getMajor();\nbeaconData.getID().getMinor();\n\n\n\n\n\nDetect presence inside a location registered on the backoffice\n\n\n\n\nRely on geolocation only\n\n\n\n\nShop shop = B4SSettings.get().currentShopWithGeolocation();\nif (shop != null) {\n    Log.d(\nB4S\n,\nYou are near=\n+shop.sName);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have deployed Neerbies in your locations\n\n\n\n\nShop shop = B4SSettings.get().currentShopWithBeacons();\nif (shop != null) {\n    Log.d(\nB4S\n,\nYou are near=\n+shop.sName);\n}\n\n\n\n\nBoth methods return a Shop class instance with the following properties available :\n\u2022 sName : Location name\n\u2022 sZipCode : Location zipcode \n\u2022 sCity : Location city\n\u2022 sCountry : Location country\n\u2022 sClientRef : Your location own reference\n\u2022 nLongitude : Location longitude\n\u2022 nLatitude : Location latitude",

The SDK uses \nSemantic Versioning\n\n\nThe \nIntegration Guide\n always describes the most up-to-date integration requirements.\n\n\nUpgrade to 2.5.5\n\n\nThis release brings stability improvements, and is a drop-in replacement for 2.5.5\n\n\nUpgrade to 2.5.4\n\n\nStarting with Android 10, ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION permission is now declared as a default in the SDK Manifest.\nSo with a target SDK \n= 29, location permission is now available when the application is in background.\nIf you do not want to enable this permission, insert the following code in your application Manifest.\n\n\nmanifest ... xmlns:tools=\nhttp://schemas.android.com/tools\n\n    ...\n    \nuses-permission android:name=\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION\n tools:node=\nremove\n/\n\n    ...\n\n/manifest\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrade to 2.5.0\n\n\nUnified method to get current shop\n\n\nUpgrade to 2.4.6\n\n\n2 new methods were added to allow presence detection inside a location.\n\n\nUpgrade to 2.4.5\n\n\nThe old B4STag API is now deprecated. It is replaced with NeerbyTag which is GDPR compliant.\n\n\nUpgrade to 2.4.0\n\n\nNow User properties must be associated with a boolean in order to specify if it has to be sent to our server or not.\n\n\nUpgrade to 2.3.15\n\n\nStarting with 2.3.15, you MUST request GDPR consentement from the application user. If not, the application will only send a minimal data set and will not send notification to the user. Please consult the GDPR page of the documentation.\n\n\nUpgrade to 2.3.12\n\n\nPreviously, the properties by.neer.sdk.AUTOSTART and by.neer.sdk.DISABLE_AUTOMATIC_INIT should be set to manage sdk activation. Starting with 2.3.12 these keys are deprecated and should not be used anymore.\nThe reason is that they can prevent SDK to work flawlessly with Android versions starting with 8.0.\n\n\nUpgrade to 2.3.11\n\n\nNotifications with images support.\nNew location tracking module must be called from the application context as in the sample code :\n  lat = LocationAwareThread.get();\n  if (lat == null) {\n    lat = new LocationAwareThread(getApplicationContext());\n  }\n\n\nUpgrade to 2.3.10\n\n\nAndroid Oreo notificatiion and Beacon detection support.\nSDK initialization changed :\n\u2022 MonitoringManager.ensureMonitoringService() call is no more supported\n\u2022 It is replaced with : B4SSettings.get.go();\n\n\nUpgrade to 2.3.5\n\n\nNotification caping support.\nPlayServices versions prior to 10.2.6 are no more supported since remote push messages causes app crashes for apps build with targetSDK 26 on Android 8.x devices. \n\n\nUpgrade to 2.2.0\n\n\nThe APP-ID should now be set in your application Manifest. The previous installation method is now deprecated. This process is detailed in the installation documentation.\nWe are now using the version 2.2.0 of retrofit.\n\n\nUpgrade to 1.8.4\n\n\nNo changes required.\n\n\nUpgrade to 1.8.3\n\n\nNo code changes required. The minimum SDK level is now set to 10, so applications targeting Android 2.3 can include the library without the need to an \noverrideLibrary\n attribute in their \nuses-sdk /\n manifest declaration.\n\n\nUpgrade to 1.8.2\n\n\nNo changes required.\n\n\nUpgrade to 1.8.1\n\n\nThe deep linking strategy can now optionally be changed. While the default delivery to the launcher Activity in a new task remains unchanged, three strategies are now available:\n\n\n\n\nLaunchActivityClearTask\n - (Default) Deep links are delivered to your launch Activity, and always in a new task (with an Activity restart)\n\n\nLaunchActivityDirect\n - Deep links are delivered to your launch Activity; if this is already running the Intent is delivered directly to your \nonNewIntent\n lifecycle method\n\n\nBroadcastReceiver\n - Deep links are broadcasted with a \ncom.ezeeworld.b4s.android.sdk.notifications.DEEP_LINK\n Intent action type\n\n\n\n\nPlease refer to the [[deep linking section|Integration-guide#deep-linking]] in the main integration document for implementation details.\n\n\nUpgrade to 1.8.0\n\n\nA Play Services support library was added in case you want to upgrade to the Play Services 8.4. Just use the \nb4s-android-sdk-playservices840.aar\n  file instead of the existing \nplayservicesXXX\n variant.\n\n\nThe Retrofit dependency was updated to incorporate stability changes and be compatible with apps that still use Retrofit 1.X. Make sure your dependency looks like:\n\n\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.0.0-beta3'\n    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-jackson:2.0.0-beta3'\n    ...\n}\n\n\n\n\nLocal logging was changed from a level-based to a feature-based distinction. To enable logging, now use the \nB4SSetting.setShouldLogScan(boolean)\n and \nB4SSetting.setShouldLogMatching(boolean)\n methods instead of \nsetShouldLogDebug\n and \nsetShouldLogVerbose\n. Scanning-related logs are reported using the \nB4SSCN\n tag, which campaign matching logs are still using the \nB4S\n tag. For example, to get all logs, use \nadb logcat -s B4SSCN:* B4S:*\n or to only get info and higher priority logs about campaign matching you can use \nadb logcat -s B4S:I\n.\n\n\nUpgrade to 1.7.0\n\n\nThe dependencies were updated for stability and additional functionality. Note that there is now an additional \ncupboard\n dependency. For Eclipse builds, the required jar files can be found in the \n/sample-eclipse/libs\n folder. For Gradle builds, ensure you refer to the correct versions:\n\n\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'nl.qbusict:cupboard:2.1.4'\n    implementation 'de.greenrobot:eventbus:2.4.0'\n    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit:retrofit:2.0.0-beta2'\n    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit:converter-jackson:2.0.0-beta2'\n    ...\n}\n\n\n\n\nUpgrade to 1.6.1\n\n\nWhen using the .JAR release with manual declarations in your \nAndroidManifest.xml\n, ensure that the GCM \npermission\n and \nuses-permission\n include your unique package name (instead of the placeholder \nYOUR-PACKAGE-NAME\n):\n\n\n   \npermission\n      android:name=\nYOUR-PACKAGE-NAME\n.permission.C2D_MESSAGE\n\n      android:protectionLevel=\nsignature\n /\n\n   \nuses-permission android:name=\nYOUR-PACKAGE-NAME\n.permission.C2D_MESSAGE\n /\n\n\n\n\n\nThe .AAR version (with Gradle) automatically injects the proper application id in the permission name, starting with this release.\n\n\nUpgrade to 1.6.0\n\n\nThe SDK was split into a core part and a connection part specific to the Play Services library that the application wants to use. This allows, for example, to stay at Play Services 6.5 while still upgrading to the latest B4S version.\n\n\nSecondly, the SDK is now also released in .AAR format, next to the existing .JAR format. When Gradle is used as build system, it is strongly recommended to use the .AAR format as it no longer requires manually declaring B4S services in the Android Manifest.\n\n\nTo upgrade start by removing the B4S services (and activities and broadcast receivers) from your \nAndroidManifest.xml\n. Next, remove the \nb4s-android-sdk.jar\n from your \n/libs\n folder and replace it with the \nb4s-android-sdk.aar\n and  \nb4s-android-sdk-playservicesXXX.aar\n .AAR files from the \n/sdk/aar\n release folder\n. The version of the \n-playservices\n .JAR file should correspond to your Play Services version. For example, use \nb4s-android-sdk-playservices830.jar\n if you are at Play Services 8.3 (v28). Finally, in your root \n/build.gradle\n file, ensure that the libs directory is added to the \nrepositories\n list. This part now looks something like:\n\n\nallprojects {\n    repositories {\n        jcenter()\n        flatDir{\n            dirs 'libs'\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nFinally, in you applications' \napp/build.gradle\n file, add the .AAR file dependencies, For example:\n\n\n    compile (name:'b4s-android-sdk', ext:'aar')\n    compile (name:'b4s-android-sdk-playservices830', ext:'aar')\n\n\n\n\nSee the \nsample-gradle\n sample project\n for an up-to-date configuration which uses Play Services 8.3.\n\n\nUpgrade to 1.5.5\n\n\nThe Google Cloud Messaging (play-services-gcm) dependency is no longer a requirement if (and only if) push messaging is not used.\n\n\nUpgrade to 1.5.4\n\n\nNo changes required.\n\n\nUpgrade to 1.5.2\n\n\nIf multiple B4S apps are installed, the SDK will now automatically choose the most recent SDK version to scan for beacons. This requires additional intent filter definitions for the \nMonitoringManager\n service. Please ensure that it is defined as:\n\n\nservice\nandroid:name=\ncom.ezeeworld.b4s.android.sdk.monitor.MonitoringManager\n\nandroid:exported=\ntrue\n\ntools:ignore=\nExportedService\n\n    \nintent-filter\n\n        \naction android:name=\ncom.ezeeworld.b4s.android.sdk.monitor.B4S_ENSURE_SCANNING\n /\n\n        \naction android:name=\ncom.ezeeworld.b4s.android.sdk.monitor.B4S_QUERY_SCHEDULE\n /\n\n        \naction android:name=\ncom.ezeeworld.b4s.android.sdk.monitor.B4S_SCHEDULE_RESULT\n /\n\n        \naction android:name=\ncom.ezeeworld.b4s.android.sdk.monitor.B4S_QUERY_VERSION\n /\n\n        \naction android:name=\ncom.ezeeworld.b4s.android.sdk.monitor.B4S_REPORT_VERSION\n /\n\n    \n/intent-filter\n\n\n/service\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrade to 1.5.0\n\n\nThe dependencies were updated for better compatibility with recent Play Services and stability. For Eclipse builds, the required jar files can be found in the /sdk/libs folder. For Gradle builds, ensure you refer to the correct versions:\n\n\n   dependencies {\n      implementation 'de.greenrobot:eventbus:2.3.0'\n      implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit:retrofit:2.0.0-beta1'\n      implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit:converter-jackson:2.0.0-beta1'\n      implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:8.1.0'\n      implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads:8.1.0'\n      implementation \ncom.google.android.gms:play-services-gcm:8.1.0\n\n      implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])\n   }\n\n\n\n\nIt is no longer necessary (nor should you) to extend from the \nB4SNotificationActivity\n or manage a \nB4SNotificationPopup\n manually. Please remove manual references to these class from your code. Not that, as part of this change, you DO have to supply your \nApplication\n object to the \nB4SSettings.init(Application, String)\n method.\n\n\nThe deep linking intent extra field constants, such as \nINTENT_TITLE\n and \nINTENT_ACTIONID\n, were moved from the \nMonitoringManager\n to the \nNotificationService\n class.\n\n\nThe scanning service was updated for greater speed and reliability, especially on devices with poor Bluetooth hardware. The demo mode (which was exclusively used for testing) is deprecated so the \nB4SSettings.setDemoMode(boolean)\n was removed.\n\n\nOn Android 6.0 a new runtime permission system was introduced, and this is now natively supported. When the user has not (yet) given permissions for the \nandroid.permission-group.LOCATION\n group, the SDK will show a request pop-up. Note that no alerts (pop-ups) will be shown if location services or bluetooth are disabled, although this \nmay now be configured\n.\n\n\nThe \nB4SSettings.storeCustomerFields()\n method was slightly changed, as it is no longer needed to supply a location while a \nuserId\n parameter was added.\n\n\nUpgrade to 1.4.5\n\n\nPush messaging support\n was added, for which a new \nB4SSettings.setPushMessagingSenderId(String)\n method was introduced. As part of the feature, the notification generation was moved and a new service declaration is required:\n\n\n      \nservice\n         android:name=\ncom.ezeeworld.b4s.android.sdk.notifications.NotificationService\n\n         android:exported=\nfalse\n /\n\n\n\n\n\nFor push messaging integration itself, please refer to the \nfull integration document\n.",

When Gradle is used as build system, it is strongly recommended to use the .AAR format as it no longer requires manually declaring B4S services in the Android Manifest.  To upgrade start by removing the B4S services (and activities and broadcast receivers) from your  AndroidManifest.xml . Next, remove the  b4s-android-sdk.jar  from your  /libs  folder and replace it with the  b4s-android-sdk.aar  and   b4s-android-sdk-playservicesXXX.aar  .AAR files from the  /sdk/aar  release folder . The version of the  -playservices  .JAR file should correspond to your Play Services version. For example, use  b4s-android-sdk-playservices830.jar  if you are at Play Services 8.3 (v28). Finally, in your root  /build.gradle  file, ensure that the libs directory is added to the  repositories  list. This part now looks something like:  allprojects {\n    repositories {\n        jcenter()\n        flatDir{\n            dirs 'libs'\n        }\n    }\n}  Finally, in you applications'  app/build.gradle  file, add the .AAR file dependencies, For example:      compile (name:'b4s-android-sdk', ext:'aar')\n    compile (name:'b4s-android-sdk-playservices830', ext:'aar')  See the  sample-gradle  sample project  for an up-to-date configuration which uses Play Services 8.3.",

The deep linking intent extra field constants, such as  INTENT_TITLE  and  INTENT_ACTIONID , were moved from the  MonitoringManager  to the  NotificationService  class.  The scanning service was updated for greater speed and reliability, especially on devices with poor Bluetooth hardware. The demo mode (which was exclusively used for testing) is deprecated so the  B4SSettings.setDemoMode(boolean)  was removed.  On Android 6.0 a new runtime permission system was introduced, and this is now natively supported. When the user has not (yet) given permissions for the  android.permission-group.LOCATION  group, the SDK will show a request pop-up. Note that no alerts (pop-ups) will be shown if location services or bluetooth are disabled, although this  may now be configured .  The  B4SSettings.storeCustomerFields()  method was slightly changed, as it is no longer needed to supply a location while a  userId  parameter was added.",
