## Sample application

A sample application is included in the `sample-eclipse` and `sample-gradle` directories of this repo. They show a basic SDK setup and they include some optional optimalizations, such as enabling debugging (in `SampleApplication`). Note that it will not run correctly until the application ID has been replaced from `MY-APP-ID` to your unique application ID. You can generate an application ID for each of your applications with 'B4S Manager' application.
